# Introduction to Strength Analysis Using Fama French Model

In this notebook, titled `Strength_Analysis_GA.ipynb`, we delve into training a strength score model based on the Fama French (FF) three-factor model. This model is designed to predict the financial strength of news items related to cryptocurrencies by analyzing their impact on market behavior. The development dataset includes `Strength/FF3_daily.csv` for the Fama French factors and `Strength/news_short.xlsx` for the news headlines, while the deployment dataset utilizes `GA_data_wsentiment.csv` as input and outputs to `GA_Results.csv`. The final output, `GA_Results.csv`, is structured similarly to `CryptoGDelt2022.csv`, albeit with some additional date fields used for organizing news by date and time.

## Objective

The aim is to create a predictive model that assesses the strength of cryptocurrency-related news by examining its correlation with market returns, based on the Fama French three-factor model. By incorporating variables such as market risk, size, and value factors from the FF model, we seek to quantify the financial impact of each news article. The enriched dataset, `GA_Results.csv`, will serve as a comprehensive tool for analyzing the influence of news on cryptocurrency markets, enhancing investment strategies and market analysis.

## Methodology

The process involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Import and preprocess the Fama French daily factors and news headlines for model training. This includes cleaning the news data and aligning it with the corresponding market data based on publication dates.

2. **Model Training**: Utilize the Fama French three-factor model to establish a baseline for expected market returns. Train a classifier to predict the strength score of news items, distinguishing between news with significant positive or negative impacts on market behavior.

3. **Model Deployment**: Apply the trained model to the `GA_data_wsentiment.csv` dataset, which contains pre-processed news items with appended sentiment analysis. The model assesses each news item's impact based on its content and sentiment, assigning a strength score that reflects its potential influence on the cryptocurrency market.

4. **Output Generation**: The resulting dataset, `GA_Results.csv`, includes the original news data along with the computed strength scores and associated financial metrics. This dataset facilitates comprehensive analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of how news sentiment and content correlate with market movements.

5. **Analysis and Visualization**: Perform further analysis on the enriched dataset to identify patterns and insights. Visualize the relationship between news strength scores and market reactions, providing actionable intelligence for market participants.

## Usage

This notebook is crucial for financial analysts, investors, and researchers aiming to gauge the impact of news on cryptocurrency markets. It enables users to filter news based on its financial strength, prioritize analysis on significant news items, and develop informed market strategies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Pandas DataReader and yfinance for financial data retrieval
- Statsmodels for statistical modeling
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Various custom functions and pipelines for data preprocessing and analysis

## Conclusion

By integrating financial models with natural language processing and machine learning, this notebook presents a novel approach to analyzing the financial strength of cryptocurrency-related news. The `GA_Results.csv` dataset not only serves as a valuable resource for understanding market dynamics but also aids in developing predictive models that can forecast market reactions to news, thereby offering strategic advantages in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
